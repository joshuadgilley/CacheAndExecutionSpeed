# CacheAndExecutionSpeed
Design a C program to measure the effect of cache memory on program execution speed

1. How big is a cache block?
2. How big is the cache?
3. How long does a reference to main memory take to complete?
4. How long does a reference that can be satisfied from cache take to complete?
